## Woodrat Nest Sizes in Relation to Habitats and Tree Sizes       

My team and I created this poster for our Ecology class as part of our lab final. We were also fortunate enough to present the poster as guests for the Department of Applied Environmental Science Fall 2024 Capstone Festival at our university!
